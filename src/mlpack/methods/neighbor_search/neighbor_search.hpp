/**
 * The NeighborSearch class is a template class for performing distance-based
 * neighbor searches.  It takes a query dataset and a reference dataset (or just
 * a reference dataset) and, for each point in the query dataset, finds the k
 * neighbors in the reference dataset which have the 'best' distance according
 * to a given sorting policy.  A constructor is given which takes only a
 * reference dataset, and if that constructor is used, the given reference
 * dataset is also used as the query dataset.
 *
 * The template parameters SortPolicy and Metric define the sort function used
 * and the metric (distance function) used.  More information on those classes
 * can be found in the NearestNeighborSort class and the kernel::ExampleKernel
 * class.
 *
 * @tparam SortPolicy The sort policy for distances; see NearestNeighborSort.
 * @tparam MetricType The metric to use for computation.
 * @tparam MatType The type of data matrix.
 * @tparam TreeType The tree type to use; must adhere to the TreeType API.
 * @tparam DualTreeTraversalType The type of dual tree traversal to use
 *     (defaults to the tree's default traverser).
 * @tparam SingleTreeTraversalType The type of single tree traversal to use
 *     (defaults to the tree's default traverser).
