 * A nested class of SpillTree which traverses the entire tree with a
 * given set of rules which indicate the branches which can be pruned and the
 * order in which to recurse.  This traverser is a depth-first traverser.
 * The Defeatist template parameter determines if the traversers must do
 * defeatist search on overlapping nodes.
