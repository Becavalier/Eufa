 * @brief Kernel functions.
 *
 * This namespace contains kernel functions, which evaluate some kernel function
 * @f$ K(x, y) @f$ for some arbitrary vectors @f$ x @f$ and @f$ y @f$ of the
 * same dimension.  The single restriction on the function @f$ K(x, y) @f$ is
 * that it must satisfy Mercer's condition:
 *
 * @f[
 * \int \int K(x, y) g(x) g(y) dx dy \ge 0
 * @f]
 *
 * for all square integrable functions @f$ g(x) @f$.
 *
 * The kernels in this namespace all implement the KernelType policy.  For more
 * information, see \ref kernels "The KernelType policy documentation".

/**
 * An example kernel function.  This is not a useful kernel, but it implements
 * the two functions necessary to satisfy the Kernel policy (so that a class can
 * be used whenever an mlpack method calls for a `typename Kernel` template
 * parameter.
 *
 * All that is necessary is a constructor and an `Evaluate()` function.  More
 * methods could be added; for instance, one useful idea is a constructor which
 * takes parameters for a kernel (for instance, the width of the Gaussian for a
 * Gaussian kernel).  However, mlpack methods cannot count on these various
 * constructors existing, which is why most methods allow passing an
 * already-instantiated kernel object (and by default the method will construct
 * the kernel with the default constructor).  So, for instance,
 *
 * @code
 * GaussianKernel k(5.0);
 * KernelPCA<GaussianKernel> kpca(dataset, k);
 * @endcode
 *
 * will set up kernel PCA using a Gaussian kernel with a width of 5.0, but
 *
 * @code
 * KernelPCA<GaussianKernel> kpca(dataset);
 * @endcode
 *
 * will create the kernel with the default constructor.  It is important (but
 * not strictly mandatory) that your default constructor still gives a working
 * kernel.
 *
 * @note
 * Not all kernels require state.  For instance, the regular dot product needs
 * no parameters.  In that case, no local variables are necessary and
 * `Evaluate()` can (and should) be declared static.  However, for greater
 * generalization, mlpack methods expect all kernels to require state and hence
 * must store instantiated kernel functions; this is why a default constructor
 * is necessary.
